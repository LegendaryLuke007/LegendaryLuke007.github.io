**TheVault** is a personal website spun up by Luke Martin, a IT Field Representative who has a passion for All things Technology.

Originally, Luke was going to college at the *University of Alaska Fairbanks* for Theoretical Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics. After three years of grueling Mathematics, he had fallen to the point of burn out where he had to find a different path. So, over the summer of 2024 he went and got his A+ certification while working as a Barista to make ends meet. Within the first 3 months of job search, he was fortunate enough to land a job with Vicinity, a up and coming local Info-Tech MSP. 

Throughout his career in Info-Tech, he has:
 
- Stood up client endpoints and various paripherals. 
- Caught and mitigated cybersecurity risks through isolation of infected systems.
- Configured restrictive firewalls on endpoints, networks, and servers.
- Configured Spam alerts for key clients and optimized email security.
- Configured automations for security scanning and vulnerability checking.
- Worked with the full suite of Microsoft 365 management (Intune, Active Directory, etc.) and Security (Microsoft Defender) Tools

He has also actively pursued related projects in security scripting, Honey-Pot management, vulnerability research, Amazon Web Services, among other things.

Luke holds an Associate of Arts from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. He is also A+ certified and is currently working on Security+.
