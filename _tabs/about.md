**TheVault** is a personal website spun up by Luke Martin, an IT Field Representative who has a passion for All things Technology.

Originally, Luke was going to college at the *University of Alaska Fairbanks* for Theoretical Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics. After three years of grueling Mathematics, he had fallen to the point of burn out where he had to find a different path. So, over the summer of 2024 he went and got his A+ certification while working as a Barista to make ends meet. Within the first 3 months of job search, he was fortunate enough to land a job with Vicinity, an up and coming local Info-Tech MSP.
